The distinction between **shallow copies** and **deep copies** is crucial for understanding how changes to copies of objects can impact the originals. Let's dive into each type of copy and when to use them.\n",

       "\n",

This means that if the inner objects are mutable (like lists, dictionaries, etc.), changes made to those inner objects in the shallow copy will also reflect in the original object, because both the original and the shallow copy refer to the same inner objects.\n",

       "   shallow_copy = copy.copy(original)\n",
       "   \n",

       "2. **Using List Slicing:**\n",

       "   original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]\n",
       "   shallow_copy = original[:]  # Works for lists\n",
       "   \n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Using the `list()` Constructor:**\n",
       "   python\n",
       "   original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]\n",
       "   shallow_copy = list(original)\n",
       "   \n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Using Dictionary's `copy()` Method:**\n",
       "   python\n",
       "   original = {'a': 1, 'b': [2, 3]}\n",
       "   shallow_copy = original.copy()  # Works for dictionaries\n",
       "   \n",
       "\n",
       "**Example:**\n",
       "python\n",
       "original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]\n",

       "**How to Create Deep Copies:**\n",

       "### When to Use Each\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Use Shallow Copies When:**\n",
       "  - You want to create a copy of an object without needing to duplicate the nested objects.\n",
       "  - You are certain that the mutable objects nested within the original object won't be modified or will be handled carefully.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Use Deep Copies When:**\n",
       "  - You need complete independence from the original object, especially if you plan to modify nested mutable objects.\n",
