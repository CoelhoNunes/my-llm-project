       "\n",
       "In Python, when you assign a new variable or pass an object to a function, it doesn't create a new copy of the original object. Instead, it creates a reference to the same object. This is because objects in Python are mutable by default, meaning they can be modified after creation.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, sometimes you want to work with a separate copy of an object, rather than modifying the original. That's where shallow and deep copies come into play.\n",

       "-----------------\n",
       "\n",
       "A shallow copy creates a new object that references the same elements as the original object. This means that if you modify a sub-object in the copied object, it will also affect the original object.\n",

       "```python\n",
