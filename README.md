# 🧠 LLM Engineering – My Journey to Master AI & LLMs

I'm diving deep into the world of AI and Large Language Models, and this repo documents the exciting projects I'm building along the way. Some are simple, others are challenging, and a few are genuinely mind-blowing — but all are designed to level up my skills as I go.

Each project builds on the last, so as I progress, the tools, techniques, and understanding grow more advanced. The best part? I'm learning by doing. Every notebook, script, and experiment here represents something I ran, tweaked, and explored myself.

## 📉 Track API Costs

I'm keeping API usage minimal. Here are the dashboards I use:

- [OpenAI usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
- [Anthropic usage](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/cost)
- [Google Gemini usage](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/generativelanguage.googleapis.com/cost)
